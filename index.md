## Infrastructure as code (**IaC**)
Everything you have to know about Infrastructure-as-code in one place.
  - "*IaC tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.*" ([Hashicorp](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code))
  - "*IaC uses a high-level descriptive coding language to automate the provisioning of IT infrastructure. This automation eliminates the need for developers to manually provision and manage servers, operating systems, database connections, storage, and other infrastructure elements every time they want to develop, test, or deploy a software application.*"([IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/infrastructure-as-code))
  - "*the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-redable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.*" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code))
  - "*the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous delivery.*" ([Docs.Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code))
