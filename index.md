## Infrastructure as code (**IaC**)
Everything you have to know about Infrastructure-as-code in one place.

  - "*the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-redable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)).*"
  - "*the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous delivery.* ([docs.microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code))"
